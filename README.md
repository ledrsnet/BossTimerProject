BossTimer Android project

This is a minimal Android Studio project skeleton (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose) for the BOSS timer app.

How to build:
1. Open Android Studio.
2. Choose "Open" and select the project folder.
3. Let Android Studio sync Gradle (it will download the required SDK and Gradle plugin).
4. Build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s)
5. The generated APK will be in: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

If you don't have Android Studio, you can upload this project to GitHub and use CI (GitHub Actions / Codemagic) to build the APK.
